# How to use docker for beginners

For a long time, I knew about docker but did not used it in any application. But today the need arises and I started using it. I had used heroku in the past so it felt a little bit similar. One can start learning docker, quickly with these commands,

- run
- stop
- images
- ps
- build
- pull
- push

For information about these commands, follow this [Guide](https://docker-curriculum.com/).
