# What is and how to use GraphQL

I have heard about GraphQL long ago, but did not get enough time or opportunity to actually use it. But lately, I have had a good reason and time to learn it.

In a simple terms, GraphQL is better REST.

GraphQL can do everything REST can but it's more efficient and seems obvious than REST.

### What I found about GraphQL?

- Proposed and used by world's leading company Facebook.
- Used by facebook, github, shopify, pinterest, coursera and many [more](https://graphql.org/users).
- Open Source
- It's a specification just like REST. you can create your own implementation given time.
- Prisma and apollo is a great tool to get started with GraphQL.
- Works with any technology just like REST.
- Seems the obivious candidate to replace REST in near future.
