# Create and Publish a new React component

I had been using react for more than 6 months and found an amazing idea for a new react component. I wanted to publish it to the npm. but before that I had to create it locally and test it. I learned it by following this [article on Medium](https://medium.com/@BrodaNoel/how-to-create-a-react-component-and-publish-it-in-npm-668ad7d363ce).

### The steps I did,

- Created project structure manually.
- Initialized package.json and installed dependencies.
- Added babel config.
- Created a webpack config file.
- Used npm link to add it to sample project locally for testing.

### A little bit about the component

- It will contain various animatation for the anchor tag/ link. However, It can be used with any clickable element. The repository is available on my github. I might change the name later but currently I have thought of awesome-react-links.

> The component is still not complete and I think it will take some time before I publish minor version.
