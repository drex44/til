# Use CDN like Prismic, Contentful, ButterCMS etc to create business user friendly dynamic sites

I had little knowledge about CDNs before but after reading through and trying Prismic and ButterCMS, I found it is very useful.
Due to the rise of SPA because of React, Angular etc to name a few, I was looking for a solution to not create a backend and still make the site dynamic so the business user can edit the content.

I found the mixture of using surge with CDN very useful. Another use case is to use it as backend for your native mobile application.
